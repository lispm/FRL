frl is the frame representation language from MIT

frl.n is the original version of the manual.
frl.manual is the manual for frl, with my changes
but it has several problems.
It has a macro .Lf which is critical to the production
of the manual, but is not defined anywhere.
to produce it, type:

	vtroff -F nonie -me -tbl frl.manual &
		it will send index entries to your terminal, ignore these.
		(notice that it uses the tbl preprocessor.)

I have hacked up a couple of the macros for the manuals, you are welcome
to fix them up even more (i.e., I only made one pass).

This file seems to contain demonstration
programs for the FRL system.

The files ending in .l can be loaded by:
(load 'filename.l)
The files ending in .o can be loaded by:
(fasl 'filename)
	i.e. they can be fast loaded.

The following demos exist and how to run them:

atn: a simple atn parser.

(fasl 'atn)
(show (atn '(the dog ate the food))

tower: the towers of hanoi.

(fasl 'tower)
(move 'disk1 'peg3)
(move 'disk5 'peg2)
(show 'disk1)
